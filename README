Epgpb = poolboy + epgsql,
Desc   = "A standalone PostgreSQL database connection pool server 
       	    application, created to support declarative application 
	    composition".

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This code is not much more than the poolboy epgsql example with the
full epgsql API implementated in poolboy workers. A code generator
(see `gen/`) builds this application dynamically from the compiled
epgsql binaries.

To use this with rebar, declare epgpb as a dependency, define your
poolboy pool setup for the epgpb application in your config file(s),
compile, and start the application.
